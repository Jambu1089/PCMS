PC STORE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM


The PC Store Management System is a desktop-based application developed using C# Windows Forms with SQL Server LocalDB as the backend database in Visual Studio 2019. The main purpose of this system is to automate and simplify the daily operations of a PC store, such as managing users, products, categories, customers, and orders.
In a traditional manual system, store management is time-consuming and prone to errors, especially when handling large amounts of data like stock quantities, customer details, and sales records. This system replaces manual record keeping with a computerized solution that ensures accuracy, efficiency, and data security. All information is stored in a centralized database, making it easy to retrieve, update, and manage records.
The system implements role-based access control, allowing different users—such as Admin, Staff, and Cashier—to access features according to their responsibilities. This improves security and ensures that sensitive operations, like user management, are only accessible to authorized users. The login system verifies user credentials and roles before granting access.
Additionally, the system supports real-time stock management, where product quantities are automatically updated after each order. This helps prevent over-selling and maintains accurate inventory levels. With a simple and user-friendly interface, the PC Store Management System provides an effective solution for managing store operations efficiently and reliably.
